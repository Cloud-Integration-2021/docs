## Lab1 - Java API Rest
Using Spring boot, Hibernate and JPA with PostgreSQL, Swagger

CRUD operations on movies. With CircuitBreaker, Retry and Timeout


There are two version of this API:
- V1: Using CircuitBreaker, Retry, TimeLimiter with annotations. All endpoints disposes of a circuit breaker, retry and only *getAll* and *getById* has TimeLimiter. </br>
Due to TimeLimiter integration tests needs to be asynchronous. </br>
So in fact, Spring root all traffic to service B. If service B is down, the circuit breaker will open. And request will be sent to himself.

- V2: Using CircuitBreaker as we saw in *spring-boot-sample*. So all crud operations are managed by Spring boot with no circuitbreaker. </br>
Only *getAll* and *getById* are managed by CircuitBreaker : all informations from Movie using JPA repository, but actors list will be managed by service B. </br> If service B is down, the circuit breaker will open. And request will be sent to himself with default list of actors. 


Each version has a different integration test. No unit test due to using JPA default repository.

Integration, building image, pushing image to registry are done with CI.  

## Lab2 - Golang API Rest
Using Gin framework, Gorm with PostgreSQL

It's a replication of the previous API but in Golang. With CRUD operations on movies.

```go
	r.GET("/movies", DB.FindMovies)
	r.GET("/movies/:id", DB.FindMovieById)
	r.POST("/movies", DB.CreateMovie)
	r.PUT("/movies/:id", DB.UpdateMovie)
	r.DELETE("/movies/:id", DB.DeleteMovie)
```

But with a new endpoint for actors and no persistent storage of actors : Genearte a random list of actors for a movie.

```go
	r.GET("/actors/:id", v2.FindActorsByMovieId)
```

Integration, building image, pushing image to registry are done with CI.  

## Lab3 - React Web App


Integration, building image, pushing image to registry are done with CI.

## Installation Steps

### Prerequisites
* Docker
* Docker-compose

### Download docker-compose.yml

```bash
$ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cloud-Integration-2021/lab-4/master/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
```

### Fill all environment variables .env

```
CLOUDINTEGRATION_DB_HOST=**
CLOUDINTEGRATION_DB_PORT=**
CLOUDINTEGRATION_DB_USER=**
CLOUDINTEGRATION_DB_PASSWORD=**
CLOUDINTEGRATION_DB_NAME_LAB2=**
CLOUDINTEGRATION_DATASOURCE_DB_URL_LAB1=jdbc:postgresql://**:**/**
```
*Lab1 & Lab2 need to have a separated database*


### Build docker-compose.yml

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

You are all set!
